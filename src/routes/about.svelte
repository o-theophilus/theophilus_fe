		<p>
			My name is <strong>Theophilus Ogbolu</strong>, and this is the "About Me" stuff...
			<br />
			<br />
			I am a self-taught student of programming and software development, and I spend way too much time
			and money pursuing this interest. My friends and family are concerned for my well-being.
			<br />
			<br />
			In August of 2013 I accepted a position as a professional developer with a startup in Lagos, Nigeria.
			So I get paid to do what I would have been doing anyway, for free.
			<br />
			<br />
			I spend most of my free time working on building my skillset, contributing to Open Source projects,
			and trying to learn as much as I can. There have been many good people who have assited me in learning
			this craft, and I try to pay that forward by helping others who may be newer than I.
			<br />
			<br />
			I have benefited in massive ways from the work of those who took the time to share their know-how
			on the internet. From various bloggers to programming forums, to the now ubiquitous Stack Overow,
			I have, in Borg-like fashion, assimilated the experience and college education of some of the biggest
			(and not so big) names in the technology arena. Shamelessly!
			<br />
			<br />
			When Iâ€™m not writing code or designing, I tend to be playing music (my other passion), exploring
			my surroundings, and doing my best to experience life beyond the code editor.
