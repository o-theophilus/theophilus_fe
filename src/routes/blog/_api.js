Web designing can be a tedious and uninteresting process, especially now that is an ever-evolving processing, you decide to learn a technology by the time you are done learning it is already obsolete and there is a new tool replacing it.

I have been in search for better approach in wed development as most of the methods were not intuitive

I found many temples engine â€“ Wix, DreamWeaver, Blue griffon, WordPress - and libraries - Angular, react jQuery mobile/ desktop, C# with razor -. Most of which will get the job done. But you will always run into issues if you have to fix a small bug or modify / add a custom feature. The source code is usually bloated and filled unnecessary and unused codes. This will be a nightmare.

I came across a [blog](https://www.simform.com/best-frontend-frameworks/#section9)  about Best Frontend Frameworks of 2021 for Web Development. That was the first time I ever came across Svelte. Guess what? Svelte was not in the top 5. Inface it was last on the list. But the outlined features caught my attention. Especially for that fact that it the newest on the list, lightweight.

I did a little search and found the maker of Svelte was one ordinary looking dude, Rich Harris was a graphics editor for New York Time.

Really! A graphic designer. Well, I could relate because at the moment I also work as a graphic designer, but I know deep down that I should be programming big time.

I was still sceptical but after watching [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao) from Rich Harris about rethinking how we build frontend Javascript frameworks and I was sold. If you have half an hour to kill and haven't seen it, check it out. I promise it is better than any content you will find on my blog.

Svelte is a new reactive component-based approach to web design. Svelte works differently by putting the work into a compile step instead of putting them in the browser, unlike frameworks like React and Vue. It does many other things easily and improves most of the bottlenecks of using other frameworks.

Visiting the official website if Svelte and Svelte kit I saw they were well documented and had good examples

At this point my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, I was ready to get my hands wet dive in head first and hope for the best.

I lunched VS Code the one IDE to rule then all, opened the node terminal and with 3 lines of code in less than 1 min I was able to get my web app up and running. My mind was blown, this must be sorcery. Never seen anything like it.


![If you are reading this it was made with Svelte](/images/svelte_02.jpg)

And the rest is history.

I would recommend Svelte

1. if you are new in web development, lucky you. You will not have to unlearn reactðŸ˜Š
2. veteran in web development, you'll realize how easy life can be
